/*
 * Scaffolding
 * Reusable CSS Framework
 *
 * Inspired and heavily influenced by:
 *  - HTML5 Boilerplate
 *  - Mobile Boilerplate
 *  - Bootstrap
 *  - Blueprint
 *  - Workless
 *  - Skeleton
 *  - BluCSS
 *  - Semantic Grid
 *  - Golden Grid System
 *  - 960.gs
 *  - Susy
 *  - Baseline CSS
 *  - Foldy 960
 *  - Fluid 960 gs
 *
 * Ordering of styles within rules:
 *  - Box model
 *  - Border
 *  - Background
 *  - Text
 *  - Other
 *
 * Note that every style should be written with a mobile-first approach.
 *
 * @media queries should always be placed immediately nested inside the
 * original rule for readability, except in special circumstances such as the
 * best-practices "print" block from HTML5BP.
 *
 * Assumes that a #wrapper div is inside the <body>, functioning as the site
 * container.
